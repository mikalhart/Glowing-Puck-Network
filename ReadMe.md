# The Glowing Wedding Puck

Glowing Pucks are coaster-sized objects ostensibly built to decorate tables at a wedding/celebration dinner, but with a few surprises.  They are small resin sculptures, made of dried English wildflowers embedded in an epoxy disc, encased in a 3D-printed shell.

## A Surprise Glow

At a 'significant moment' in the dinner (e.g. when bride and groom reappear), the various Pucks around the room mysteriously begin to glow: first one... then two... then eventually all of them.  Soon the whole room is illuminated with bright, colorful swirling light!

## Understanding the Glow

A speaker suddenly stands and explains to the murmuring guests that the  Glow we are witnessing is a symbol of the love and support we share for the new couple on the threshold of their married life.  It celebrates that we are a loving people who came together on this memorable day to wish them happiness.

## A New Surprise: More Glows to Come

As the dinner progresses, the Pucks continue to Glow cheerily, but eventually they fade away and resume their inert state. The speaker rises once again.  The initial Glow phase has ended, she explains. In preparation for the next, we are to take our Pucks home, join them to our house WiFi, and place them in a prominent location.

We learn that we have been given the power to recreate the wedding Glow at any time by touching the brass discs hidden on the underside.  An activated Puck sends a quiet message to its siblings around the world, inviting them all to join in a five-minute Glow. Touching the brass discs triggers a global chorus of light and remembrance.

It's a beautiful way for us to commemorate the wedding and keep its memory fresh and alive.  It's how we'll reach out and say, "we remember you, and we remember this day!"

## One Final Surprise

There is one more surprise in store.  Every year on the date of the wedding anniversary, the Pucks all perform a special celebration Glow that lasts the entire day.

## Theory of Operation

### At the Dinner

The Pucks are built to operate in two different modes.  As table ornaments, they are mostly asleep/inert, running off battery power and invisibly awakening every minute to check for special instructions.

At the predetermined time, the speaker (or someone in the audience) quietly enables a special 2.4GHz "Hot Spot" on her smartphone.  This is the signal to begin.  When the Pucks detect the new WiFi SSID **wedding-fireworks**, they know to begin the spectacular celebration Glow.

The Pucks Glow for as long as that special WiFi SSID is enabled.  Once it disappears, they resume their semi-dormant state.

### At Home

After the Pucks have been distributed to their new homes, they must be connected to WiFi to sync with the 'Glow network'.  At this point they should be kept more or less always plugged in.

Teaching a Puck its new home's WiFi credentials involves putting it into "WiFi Training Mode" and configuring it with a cell phone or tablet. Instructions can be found in the [WiFi Training](WiFi-Training.md) document.

Once set up, a Puck at home wakes whenever its brass discs are touched.  This triggers a glow that cascades around the world (limit one activation per Puck per day).

A Puck at home also wakes each minute to check whether any other Puck on the network has activated a Glow.  If so, it joins in!
