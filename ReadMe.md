# The Glowing Wedding Puck

Glowing Pucks are small epoxy sculptures with unexpected surprises, designed to decorate tables at a wedding/celebration dinner.  They are made of dried English wildflowers embedded in an epoxy 'coaster', encased in a 3D-printed shell.![Pre-glow Puck](Images/Puck.jpg)

## A Surprising Glow

At a 'significant moment' at the dinner (e.g. when bride and groom reappear), the Pucks around the room mysteriously begin to glow: first one, then two, and eventually all of them.  Soon the whole room is illuminated with bright, colorful swirling light!

### The Meaning of the Glow

A speaker stands and explains to the murmuring guests that the Glowing Pucks are symbols of the love and support we  share for the new couple on the threshold of their married life. The synchonized light-show we are witnessing is to be the first of many such 'Glows', reminding us of the day we   gathered joyfully together in this lovely place.

### Taking Home the 'Glow'

As the dinner ends, the Glowing Pucks go dark and the speaker rises again.  We are to take our Pucks home, she says, join them to our household WiFi, and place them somewhere they can be easily seen.

We learn that each of us will be able to recreate the wedding Glow at home by touching the pair of brass discs hidden on the underside.  A Puck so activated sends a quiet message to its brother Pucks around the world, inviting them to join in a five-minute Glow. Every time one Puck is touched, a global chorus of light is triggered.

It's a beautiful way to commemorate the wedding and keep its memory fresh and alive.  It's how we'll say, "we remember this day!"

## Theory of Operation

### At the Dinner

The Pucks are built to operate in two different modes.  As celebration table ornaments, they are mostly asleep/inert, running off battery power and invisibly awakening every minute or so to check for special messages.

At the predetermined time, the speaker (or someone in the audience) quietly enables a special 2.4GHz "Hot Spot" on her smartphone.  This is the signal to begin.  When the Pucks next wake from sleep and discover the new WiFi SSID **wedding-fireworks**, they know to begin the spectacular Glow.

The Pucks Glow for as long as the special WiFi SSID is enabled.  Once it disappears, they resume their semi-dormant state.

### At Home

After the Pucks have been distributed to their new homes, they must be connected to WiFi to sync with the Glow network.  By now they should be kept more or less always plugged in.

Teaching a Puck its new home's WiFi credentials involves putting it into WiFi training mode and talking to it with a cell phone. Instructions can be found in the [WiFi Training](WiFi-Training.md) document.
